# CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION REPORT DB

### SCENARIO

In response to the challenges posed by inflation and the increasing cost of living, a marketing agency has initiated a collaboration with a bank. 
The objective is to leverage the bank's expertise by analysing customer spending data.

This data will serve as a foundation for the marketing agency's efforts to identify distinct customer groups based on their spending patterns. 
Subsequently, the agency intends to craft highly personalised marketing messages tailored to these specific customer segments.

### CRITERIA FROM THE MARKERTING FIRM:
- Spending Data for the month of July and August 2023
- A mix of female and male
- Must be 18 years old 
- Weather details when spending took place 
- Inflation Rate for the month
- To understand the spending habits and trends of UK consumers

As a Business/Strategy Analyst within the Bank's Customer Insights team, my key objectives for this project are to:

**Analyse UK Consumer Spending Trends:**
My role involves delving into the spending habits of consumers in the UK during the specified period of July and August 2023. 
I aim to uncover how these spending patterns are evolving in the context of the rising cost of living.

**Deriving Actionable Insights:**
By harnessing our extensive customer transaction data, my aim is to extract meaningful insights that will be presented 
in the Customer Segmentation Report. This report will serve as a valuable resource to the marketing firm.

**Empowering Informed Decision-Making:** 
My work will contribute to helping the markerting firm gain a deeper understanding of consumers behaviours. 
By providing data-driven insights, we will enable the markerting firm to make informed decisions and adapt their strategies to 
effectively respond to the dynamic economic and social landscape.
